### [Copy playlist to folder](./copyPlaylist.py)

Takes an m3u with absolute paths and copies all songs into a new folder (preserving structure), creating a new m3u with relative paths.

### [Change absolute reference](./copyPlaylist.py)

Takes a playlist with an absolute reference and changes it to another given one, whilst saving the new one into the desired folder (useful to convert between iTunes libraries to new ones).
